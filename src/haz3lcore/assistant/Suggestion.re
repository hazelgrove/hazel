/* TyDi: Type-Directed Next-Token Suggestions

    IDEA: Expanded criteria for when to autoshow: Currently, we show only
    when there is at least one suggestion which prefix-matches but is not
    identical to the current nonzero prefix. We might consider relaxing
    the nonzero prefix part. We probably don't want to autoshow on correct
    tokens, but we could autoshow on errors if there are fixes, or on
    empties if there's only one option.

     IDEA: Add a keybinding to force reveal suggestion if not current shown.
     I've stubbed this out (Cmd+?) but needs an option to show suggestions
     even if on hole (ie prefix for completion is "")

     IDEA: If there are ~ no current suggestions, and the indicated term
     has a type error suggest following infixes which fix that type error,
     e.g. given "let a:Float = fst(1.0|" suggest comma
     e.g. given "let b:Bool = 1|" suggest <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, etc.

     IDEA: UNBIDIRECTIONAL POSITIONS:
    1. In ap funpos: favor input ty consistent with arg
    2. In case scrut, favor the tys of extant patterns
    3. In list element, favor the tys of extant elements
    3. In pattern annotation type: favor patann expected type

    IDEA: If on infix op, suggest based on either operand type,
    especially the case where it would fix an operand type error

    IDEA: If on 2-multihole, suggest infix ops as above or Ap if applicable
